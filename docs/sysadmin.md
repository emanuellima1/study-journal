- `etc`: Host-specific system configuration
- `home`: Users directories
- `lib`: Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
- `media`: Mount point for removable media
- `mnt`: Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily
- `opt`: Add-on application software packages
- `proc`: Kernel and process file system
- `root`: Home directory for the root user
- `run`: Data relevant to running processes
- `sbin`: Essential system binaries
- `srv`: Data for services provided by this system
- `sys`: Kernel and system information
- `usr/bin`: Most user commands
- `usr/include`: Standard header files
- `usr/lib`: Libraries for programming and packages
- `usr/libexec`: Binaries run by other programs
- `usr/local`: Local software
- `usr/share`: Arch independent data
- `tmp`: Temporary files
- `var`: Variable data
- `var/spool/cron`: Cron jobs' data

### Commands

- `cmp [options] [file1] [file2]`: compare two files byte by byte.
- `find [options] [start directory] -name [pattern]`: searches for files.
- `plocate [pattern]`: searches for files. `sudo updatedb` to update its database.
- `tree [options] [directory]`: a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth indented listing of files. `-L` sets the max display depth of the directory tree.
- `cp [options] [origin] [destination]`: copy from `origin` to `destination`. `-i` asks before copying. `-r` recursive copy. `-t folder` copy everything from origin into folder. `-T` destination is a file.
- `mv [options] [origin] [destination]`: move/rename from `origin` to `destination`. `-i` asks before moving. `-t folder` move everything from origin into folder. `-T` destination is a file.
- `rm [options] [file]`: remove/rename `file`. `-i` asks before removing. `-r` recursive remove.
- `ln -s [origin] [destination]`: soft link from `origin` to `destination`.

### Permissions

- `d rwx rwx rwx`: if directory and read, write, execute for user, group and others
- `groups [user]`: list the groups the user is a member of
- `chgrp [options] [group] [file]`: change the group of the file
- `chown [options] [user] [file]`: change the user of the file
- `chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r [file]`: change the permissions of the file to the exact ones provided
- `chmod u+wx [file]`: add permissions to the file
- `chmod ug-wx [file]`: remove permissions from the file

## Shell

### Wildcards

Wildcards are placeholders for omitted letters or numbers:

- `?`: placeholder for one character
- `*`: placeholder for zero or more characters

### Commands

- `wc [options] [file]`: prints metrics from file. `-c`counts bytes, `-m` counts chars, `-l` counts lines, `-w` counts words.
- `head [-n] [file]`: prints the first n lines of file
- `tail [-n] [file]`: prints the last n lines of file

- `sort [options] [files...]`: sort lines of text files. `-t char` char delimited files, `+n` sort by the nth field, `-n` sort numerically
